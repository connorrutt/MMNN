# PROJECT CLARIFICATION AND UPDATE 2024
## Few additions to the collective, want to add on the usage of pointnet, as we start to utilize .OBJ and .FBX file types within multi-modal testing.

# PROJECT UPDATE 10/16
## This project has expanded into evaluating 3D Content on a custom built and trained network. This is using the framework of pointnet ad yoloV8 to predit harmful content in user generated 3d games.

This aims to be built into the platform, but am still in the early stages of development.

Content undergoes segmentation via yolov8 classification along with tensorflow for categorization and potential harm ranking. Content can be measured via engagement, with things gaining rapid engagement meeting a higher criterea.

## In closed testing while awaiting proper licensing teams to confirm release of final models, GUIs, and the re-works of premade models such as YOLOv8.
